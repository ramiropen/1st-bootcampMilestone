# 1st-bootcampMilestone

This is my first game, first milestone, first solo project finished to be reviewed and graded by another source. 

This game is a crossword puzzle based of 90's cartoons from various tv channels 
such as: Cartoon Network, Nickelodean, etc. 

There will be a an input form where you can submit your answers. If you answer correctly, the answer will appear on the grid in the correct row. Answer wrong 
and nothing will change. 

hints and a link to the answers will be provided.

The goal of this game is simple, complete the puzzle and maybe; just maybe I 
will add a surprise for completion. If I am skilled enough to do so haha. Good luck!

Tip: Do not, use space while spelling
